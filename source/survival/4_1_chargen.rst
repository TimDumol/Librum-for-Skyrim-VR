Character Creation
------------------

Appearance and Race
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you boot up Librum and create a new game, you'll find yourself in the new character creation area -- the `Nightmare of Lorkhan <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46649>`_ -- looking at the `RaceMenu <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080>`_ menu. Before finalizing your race and appearance, here are the details you need to know:

**Race Abilites.** Race abilities are given by `Legacy - A Race Overhaul <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415>`_\ , with two modifications. Argonians are 50% resistant to *water damage*\ , and Orcs are 50% resistant to *earth damage*. These are new damage types introduced by `Elemental Destruction Magic <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/440>`_\ , and you will encounter enemy mages who make use of them. For detailed information on racial abilities, see the `Legacy mod page <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415>`_\ ; notably, once-a-day powers have been supplemented with interesting passive abilities that enemies will have too.

There are a few non-ability-related differences between the various races. Importantly, *beast races cannot wear shoes*. In addition to locking them out of certain enchantments (e.g., muffle), this gives both Khajiits and Argonians a higher susceptibility to frostbite. You'll need to find alternate solutions, like magical spells or avoiding Skyrim's northern reaches, in order to avoid the cold.

**Appearance.** Next, you'll notice that the character appearance menu is a little janky for those of you playing VR. Unfortunately, that's the state of the art in Skyrim VR; to fine-tune settings, you need to make use of the new cursor. In particular, Librum comes with a few hundred graphical *overlays* for your character: tattoos, scars, freckles, and more. These can be found in the *Makeup* and *Paint* tabs, at the far right of the menu. To apply a new overlay, click "Choose Texture" at the bottom of the menu, navigate to the one you want (using the cursor to scroll), and select it. Then, click "Choose Color" and repeat.

The Nightmare of Lorkhan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you finish selecting your race, gender, and appearance, you will be put into the `Nightmare of Lorkhan <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46649>`_ before venturing out into Skyrim. At this point, remember to set your MCM settings according to the `Readme <README.md#configure-the-mcm>`_.

Here are a few things to note about the Nightmare of Lorkhan:


* You will need the torches on the table beside you to navigate the Realm.
* Be careful as there are a few bear traps placed around. Watch the ground.
* Please check the entirity of the Realm, there's a few armour & weapon sets placed around for you, as well as some gold, a pickaxe and a woodcutter's axe.
* Once you leave the Realm, you cannot re-enter. For this reason, I recommend you make a save before exiting to Skyrim.
* You can only choose a Standing Stone blessing from within the Nightmare of Lorkhan. Standing Stones still exist around Skyrim, but they are only aesthetic.

**Standing Stones.** Every Standing Stone can be found within the Nightmare of Lorkhan, and -- as mentioned -- you can only choose a Standing Stone blessing while you are within the Realm. These blessings are governed by `Curse of the Firmament <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28419>`_. Notably, each stone has both a blessing and a curse, and the modpage gives you recommended builds for each, as well as a difficulty rating.

**Wintersun Faiths.** Shrines to the Nine Divines are also in the Nightmare. You can use these to choose a deity for your character to worship, thereby receiving bonuses and abilities if you increase your favor with them. Each deity is listed at `Wintersun Faiths of Skyrim <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506>`_\ , but you'll have to discover any other shrines once you are actually in Tamriel to worship other deities.

**Daggerfall Traits.** To help assist you in your builds, we have a tweaked version `Daggerfall Traits <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29416>`_\ , bringing the classic traits from Daggerfall into Skyrim via a point-buy system. For each Benefit you take, you spend points. To get more points, you must give yourself a Detriment. You can have 5 traits total. Once you have chosen your traits, you are asked to confirm them. Once you confirm, you *cannot change them again*\ , please make sure you are 100% on your choice before confirming.

**Use the Character Creation hub!** To keep track of the immense customizability of your starting build, there is a `Librum Character Creation page <https://librum-modpack.com/?page_id=296>`_\ ! There you can find a list of every race, stone, faith, and trait, as well as a character builder tool where you can see your selections all in one place. Feel free to share your build on the Librum Discord or Subreddit, too!

**Starting Locations.** Once you've chosen your traits, your standing stone and found your equipment, you have to choose where to start out in Skyrim. As mentioned before, you *cannot re-enter the Realm* once you leave, so choose carefully.

Since the fast travel network is much denser in Librum's Skyrim -- with several new carriages and boats to bring you from place to place, thanks to `CFTO <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379>`_ -- it largely does not matter if you start in one city or another. However, you'll want to be careful if you start in the wilderness or (even more dangerously) in a dungeon. Dungeons are now at fixed levels (labeled when you point your hand at the corresponding teleportation crystal), so make sure you choose a low-level one or feel particularly confident. Similarly, different wilderness zones offer different challenges, as catalogued in the `Creatures and Encounter Zones <#creatures-and-encounter-zones>`_ section later on. Do note that the vanilla start is completely disabled, so starting at Helgen or the border will not start the main quest automatically.
